# Train-Scheduler

https://mawil583.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

This is a train scheduler where you can see existing trains or add your own train to the schedule. These trains run 24/7, so there is no reset time. 

The Moment.js library was used to simplify the time conversions. jQuery was used for DOM manipulation. The train information is stored in Google's Firebase Realtime database. Bootstrap was used for styling.
